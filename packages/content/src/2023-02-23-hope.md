## Wilf & Sid

The village of Hope, a few miles south of Chester. A house-sitting gig for
three nights. Two black Labrador retrievers, Wilf and Sid, aged four and two.

Early each morning, I'd awaken to the sound of their barks, tails wagging
impatiently as they waited for me to let them outside. Donning my wellies, I'd
grab their leads and follow them as they bounded out the door, Wilf bouncing in
excitement while Sid held his lead with diligence.

The journey to the park was a simple one, down a lane and across a busy road.
Once there, I'd release them from their leads, and they'd dash off to do their
business, exploring the sights and smells of the lush surroundings.

As we walked through fields and along a shallow river, Sid would occasionally
stop to gaze expectantly at me, his eyes begging for a stick to be thrown into
the water. Wilf, on the other hand, would dig a hole in the dirt bank and stick
his nose in, savoring whatever scent he found there.

Throughout our walk, we'd encounter other dogs and their owners, and I'd keep
the pair on their leads for safety. Though they were typically friendly, you
never know how other dogs will react.

Finally, we'd cross the river on a bridge and head back home. As we walked back
up the lane, I'd hang up their leads and towel them off before feeding them
breakfast. The routine continued each day, a peaceful and pleasant experience
in the company of these two loyal companions.

I've put together a short video of one of our morning walks.
