{% extract title="Brick Project: Glen Park Avenue" href="https://www.brickproject.co.uk/projects/glen-park-avenue-steps-plymouth" %}

Over the years, this neglected space near the Railway Station has been
tarnished with litter, graffiti and illegal dumping. Brick Project, in
association with Mayflower 400 turned it into a permanent piece of public art.
The walls were painted in acrylic, one brick at a time by locals guided by paid
Plymothian assistant artist Facilitators between May 21st & 31st 2021.

Although nearby houses appear on the 1910 OS map, the steps themselves aren't
shown until the 1930s and are not considered historically significant. We
safely delivered this activity following social distancing measures. The
activity was free and open to literally everyone.

## Posessions

The main reason I had for coming back to Plymouth was to clear out my storage
locker. I had been using Big Yellow Storage, paying nearly £50 a month to stow
a suitcase of posessions. Stuff I had brought over from New Zealand but barely
used.

One of the things I had brought over with me is a bar of soap that smells like
Rotorua!

My favourite cafe in Plymouth, next to the Royal William Yard.

Fantastic bagels.

Outdoor seating (there are a couple of tables indoors but they are often
occupied). They do a fantastic flat white coffee.

No wifi, use your hotspot.
