# [Terrasini, Sicilia](location/it-terrasini.md) (November 2022)

On **Tuesday, 8th November, 2022**, Marika and I traveled across Sicily, from
[Taormina](./2022-11-05-sicilia-taormina.md) on the east coast, down to
[Catania](./2022-11-02-sicilia-catania.md), over to
[Palermo](./2022-10-28-sicilia-palermo.md) and out to the Palermo airport.
Marika was catching a flight back to France, I'm staying in Sicily for a bit
longer.

Terrasini is only a 25 minute drive from the Palermo airport, but it's a pain
to get between the two on public transport. Fortunately, my AirBnB host offered
to give me a lift.

Terrasini is a cute little city. In November, it feels like it's mostly locals
here. 

I'm here for a week, staying in this great AirBnB. It has a fantastic terrace,
where I can work with a sea view. It overlooks a fountain and a statue of the
Fiesta di lie Schiette. I'm surrounded by small caffes and restauratns. A a
minute away from this gorgeous beach.

Downsides: Every day, the church opposite will ring there bells very
loudly. Also cars playing music reverberating off the walls. 

### Running

I got back into running while I was here. There is a 3 mile
stretch of road that follows the coast which is quite pleasant to run along.
Quite a few other runners about and people just out for a walk.

### Swimming

I love visiting the little beach, La Praiola. The city is about 30m above sea
level, so you first get this great view down into the cove before walking down
the steps.

The beach is pretty small, but always quiet, sometimes I'm the only person down
there. Because it is surrounded by cliffs, the sunsets a bit earlier, so I'm
normally there around 4pm to sit on the eastern side and catch the last rays. 

The water is quite shallow, with a soft sandy floor. I never saw any waves out
there, great for just floating around and relaxing. 

It's also a great beach for skipping stones. There are plenty of flat smooth
stones in the sand.

### Food

This AirBnB has a great outdoor kitchen on the terrace, so I've been
cooking meals this week. I haven't found in hummus in the supermarkets here.
Mostly eating ravioli topped with grilled vegetables. 

- Bottega 89
  * Caffe right next door to the AirBnB, also happens to be one of the best
    places here. Great coffee and selection of pastries.
- Gelateria Vernaci
  * Dangerously good gelato, best place I've seen in Sicily. Ice cream is all kept
    inside the tubs, so you know it's good. Great range of toppings. 
- U Cuoppu Ra Favarotta
  * €5 euro for a pretty decent pizza margherita 
- Ouh lá lá
  * French restaurant, also next door, with decent reviews. Haven't been here
    yet though.

### Festa di li Schietti

I would like to return to Terrasini at Easter and witness the "Feast of Il
Schietti".

  title="Easter: The 'Li Schietti' Festival in Terrasini"
  href="http://www.sicilianjourney.com/en/event/celebrations-and-festivals/pasqua-festa-de-li-schietti-a-terrasini/" %}

  The Li Schietti festival, which is unlike any other festival anywhere, attracts
  thousands of enthusiastic visitors every year. The star of the festival is a
  tree. The test of skill features a young man or schetto (bachelor) showing off
  his ability and strength to impress and win the heart of the girl he loves. To
  accomplish this he must pick up a 50-55 kg orange tree, raise it over his head
  and, with one hand, twirl it for as long as possible as a show of his strength
  and virility. The festival is not an old one and dates to the late 1800s –
  early 1900s. It recalls pagan spring festivals held in honour of Adonis and
  connects the beginning of the equinox with Easter and the triumph of new life.
